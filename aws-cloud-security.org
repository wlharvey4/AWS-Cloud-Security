* About the Course
:PROPERTIES:
:unnumbered: t
:END:

Data security is on the forefront of everyone’s mind these days, with data breaches, denial of
service attacks, ransomware and malware being common news stories.

In this course two of Amazon Web Services’ Solutions Architects will provide you with a
foundational understanding of cloud security, compliance and the AWS shared responsibility
model. They will then discuss more technical content by looking at various security controls such
as identity and access management services, directory services, network isolation and connectivity
options, auditing, monitoring, encryption and managing secrets.

This course will cover a number of AWS services, such as Amazon VPC, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS
CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon EC2, and AWS Secrets
Manager, among others.

Several demonstrations are provided throughout the course to provide a practical example of the
concepts that have been discussed. Class discussions will provide an opportunity for you to
interact with fellow students as well as AWS training staff.

- Length :: 4 weeks
- Effort :: 2–4 hours per week
- Institution :: AWS
- Level :: Introductory

** What You Will Learn
- How the AWS Shared Responsibility Model is used to differentiate between security of the cloud
  and security in the cloud
- How to use network isolation to protect cloud resources
- How to audit and monitor applications using services such as Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon GuardDuty
  and AWS Security Hub
- The difference between encryption of data at rest and data in transit
- How to protect compute resources
- How to manage secrets

* 1. Introduction to Cloud Security
Week 1 is all about the basics. 

** Introduction to AWS Cloud Security
- Fundamentals of cloud security
  - shared responsibility security model
- Compliance in AWS
- Account managment
  - creating accounts
  - managing multiple accounts
  - securing account and api service calls

** The AWS Shared Responsibility Model
-  https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

[[file:resources/images/shared_responsibility_model-50.png]]

#+cindex:security and compliance
#+cindex:shared responsibility
Security and Compliance is a /shared responsibility/ between AWS and the customer.  This shared
model can help relieve customer’s operational burden as AWS operates, manages and controls the
components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of
the facilities in which the service operates.

Amazon provides AWS Security Services, such as:
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Amazon Cognito


#+cindex:security group firewall
The customer assumes responsibility and management of:
- the guest operating system (including updates and security patches),
- other associated application software as well as
- the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall.


{{{subheading(Responsibilities vary based upon chosen services)}}}

Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as their responsibilities vary
depending on the services used, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and
applicable laws and regulations.  The nature of this shared responsibility also provides the
flexibility and customer control that permits the deployment.

*** AWS Security Services---Responsibilities
#+cindex:shared responsibiltiy model

[[file:resources/images/shared_responsibility_model_v2-50.png]]

{{{subheading(Security “of” the Cloud)}}}
AWS is responsible for security “of the Cloud”:
- accounts
- networking
- access
- infrastructure


{{{subheading(Infrastructure)}}}

AWS is responsible for protecting the /infrastructure/ that runs all of the services offered in the
AWS Cloud.  This infrastructure is composed of:
  - the hardware,
  - software,
  - networking, and
  - facilities that run AWS Cloud services.


AWS is responsible for security “of the cloud”
- S3
- IoT Core
- Amazon SageMaker
- Amazon RDS


{{{subheading(Region Security)}}}

AWS is also responsible for securing the infrastructure of its regions.
- AWS global infrastructure
- Regions
- Availability zones
- Edge locations

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Amazon Cognito


*** AWS Customer Responsibilities

Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects.  This
determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security
responsibilities.

#+cindex:Elastic Compute Cloud EC2
#+cindex:EC2
#+cindex:Infrastructure as a Service Iaas
#+cindex:IaaS
#+cindex:security group, firewall
#+cindex:firewall, security group
For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer to perform all of the
necessary security configuration and management tasks.  Customers that deploy an Amazon EC2
instance are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and
security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the
instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each
instance.

#+cindex:abstracted services
#+cindex:S3
#+cindex:DynamoDB
For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, AWS operates the infrastructure
layer, the operating system, and platforms, and customers access the endpoints to store and
retrieve data.  Customers are responsible for managing their data (including encryption options),
classifying their assets, and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions.

{{{subheading(Security “in” the Cloud)}}}

The customer is responsible for security “in the cloud”
- whatever you build must be secured by you
- home alarm system; AWS provides it, but you need to operate it

** Compliance

Detailed information about AWS Compliance programs can be found here:
- https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/
- https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/

#+cindex:compliance
- PCI compliant


#+cindex:scope of compliance efforts
We include services in the scope of our compliance efforts based on the expected use case, feedback
and demand.  If a service is not currently listed as in scope of the most recent assessment, it
does not mean that you cannot use the service.  It is part of the shared responsibility for your
organization to determine the nature of the data.  Based on the nature of what you are building on
AWS, you should determine if the service will process or store customer data and how it will or
will not impact the compliance of your customer data environment.

*** Best Practices
- Understand compliance objectives and requirements
- Establish controlled environment that meets objectives and requirements
- Understand validation required based on your organization’s risk tolerance
- Verification of operating effectiveness of controlled environment
